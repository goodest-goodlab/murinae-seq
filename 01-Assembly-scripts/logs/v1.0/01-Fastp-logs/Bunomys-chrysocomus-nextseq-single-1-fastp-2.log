Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 505984
reads failed due to low quality: 4576
reads failed due to too many N: 40
reads failed due to too short: 845
reads failed due to low complexity: 43
reads with adapter trimmed: 1343
bases trimmed due to adapters: 50136

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.81792%
