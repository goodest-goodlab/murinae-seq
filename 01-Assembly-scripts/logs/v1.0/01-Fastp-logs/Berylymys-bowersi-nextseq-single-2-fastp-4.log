Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 750616
reads failed due to low quality: 4699
reads failed due to too many N: 45
reads failed due to too short: 437
reads failed due to low complexity: 47
reads with adapter trimmed: 3420
bases trimmed due to adapters: 58779

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 4.31325%
