Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 431440
reads failed due to low quality: 3449
reads failed due to too many N: 24
reads failed due to too short: 169
reads failed due to low complexity: 36
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.57306%
