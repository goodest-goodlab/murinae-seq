Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 458475
reads failed due to low quality: 2446
reads failed due to too many N: 0
reads failed due to too short: 66
reads failed due to low complexity: 24
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 3.30168%
