Q20 bases: 22483522(95.0755%)
Q30 bases: 21957504(92.8512%)

Read1 after filtering:
total reads: 310701
total bases: 23467241
Q20 bases: 22385920(95.3922%)
Q30 bases: 21872062(93.2025%)

Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 310701
reads failed due to low quality: 2291
reads failed due to too many N: 5
reads failed due to too short: 42
reads failed due to low complexity: 23
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.65855%
