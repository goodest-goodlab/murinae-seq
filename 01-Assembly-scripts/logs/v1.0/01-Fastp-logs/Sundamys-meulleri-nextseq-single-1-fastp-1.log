Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 377393
reads failed due to low quality: 2978
reads failed due to too many N: 39
reads failed due to too short: 139
reads failed due to low complexity: 30
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.79618%
