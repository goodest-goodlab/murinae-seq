Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 447008
reads failed due to low quality: 3291
reads failed due to too many N: 25
reads failed due to too short: 140
reads failed due to low complexity: 25
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.79771%
