Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 355594
reads failed due to low quality: 2159
reads failed due to too many N: 6
reads failed due to too short: 91
reads failed due to low complexity: 27
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.88333%
