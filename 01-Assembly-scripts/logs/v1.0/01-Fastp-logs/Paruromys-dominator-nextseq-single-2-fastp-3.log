Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 276066
reads failed due to low quality: 1753
reads failed due to too many N: 10
reads failed due to too short: 79
reads failed due to low complexity: 19
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.43973%
