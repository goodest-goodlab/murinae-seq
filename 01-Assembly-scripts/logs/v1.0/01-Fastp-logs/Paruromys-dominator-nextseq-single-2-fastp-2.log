Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 289891
reads failed due to low quality: 1687
reads failed due to too many N: 0
reads failed due to too short: 28
reads failed due to low complexity: 23
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.62894%
