Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 452825
reads failed due to low quality: 2403
reads failed due to too many N: 2
reads failed due to too short: 150
reads failed due to low complexity: 16
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 3.25056%
