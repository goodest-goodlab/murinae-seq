Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 438836
reads failed due to low quality: 2601
reads failed due to too many N: 3
reads failed due to too short: 41
reads failed due to low complexity: 16
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 3.10486%
