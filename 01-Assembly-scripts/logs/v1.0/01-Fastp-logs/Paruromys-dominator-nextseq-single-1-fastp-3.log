Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 298442
reads failed due to low quality: 2431
reads failed due to too many N: 24
reads failed due to too short: 92
reads failed due to low complexity: 18
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.47891%
