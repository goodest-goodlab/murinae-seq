Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 345320
reads failed due to low quality: 2291
reads failed due to too many N: 21
reads failed due to too short: 97
reads failed due to low complexity: 29
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.72804%
