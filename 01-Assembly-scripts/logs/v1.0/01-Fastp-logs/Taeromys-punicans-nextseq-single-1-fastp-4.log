Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 444431
reads failed due to low quality: 3149
reads failed due to too many N: 17
reads failed due to too short: 52
reads failed due to low complexity: 34
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.79868%
