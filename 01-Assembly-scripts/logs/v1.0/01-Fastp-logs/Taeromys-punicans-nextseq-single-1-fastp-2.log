Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 451269
reads failed due to low quality: 3207
reads failed due to too many N: 7
reads failed due to too short: 112
reads failed due to low complexity: 33
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.79117%
