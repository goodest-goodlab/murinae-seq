Q20 bases: 34580313(95.408%)
Q30 bases: 33834271(93.3497%)

Read1 after filtering:
total reads: 476337
total bases: 35979633
Q20 bases: 34437734(95.7145%)
Q30 bases: 33709424(93.6903%)

Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 476337
reads failed due to low quality: 3346
reads failed due to too many N: 42
reads failed due to too short: 61
reads failed due to low complexity: 17
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 3.19038%
