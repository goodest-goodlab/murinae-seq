total bases: 23694454
Q20 bases: 22545696(95.1518%)
Q30 bases: 22012953(92.9034%)

Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 313696
reads failed due to low quality: 2449
reads failed due to too many N: 6
reads failed due to too short: 99
reads failed due to low complexity: 36
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.61106%
