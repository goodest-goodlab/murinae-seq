Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 393443
reads failed due to low quality: 2423
reads failed due to too many N: 2
reads failed due to too short: 38
reads failed due to low complexity: 29
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.54308%
