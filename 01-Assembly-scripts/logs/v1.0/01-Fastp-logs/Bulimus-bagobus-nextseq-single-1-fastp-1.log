Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 460311
reads failed due to low quality: 2915
reads failed due to too many N: 19
reads failed due to too short: 50
reads failed due to low complexity: 32
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.93138%
