Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 504087
reads failed due to low quality: 3448
reads failed due to too many N: 8
reads failed due to too short: 169
reads failed due to low complexity: 20
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 3.35928%
