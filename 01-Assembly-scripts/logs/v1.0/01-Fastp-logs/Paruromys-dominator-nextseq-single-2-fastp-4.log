Filtering result:
reads passed filter: 284443
reads failed due to low quality: 1692
reads failed due to too many N: 1
reads failed due to too short: 74
reads failed due to low complexity: 24
reads with adapter trimmed: 0
bases trimmed due to adapters: 0

Duplication rate (may be overestimated since this is SE data): 2.57777%
